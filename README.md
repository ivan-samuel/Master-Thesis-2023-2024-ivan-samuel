# Master-Thesis-2023-ivan-samuel

This repository is created with the objective of providing reproducibility of the results in my Master Thesis to my correctors.

The notebook called modelos_gp_vbl_meteoro.ipynb has commented cells in order to avoid training all the models each time that the results want to be accessed. This is useful to make comprobations and experiment with different visualizations of the results in order to provide more intuitive and transparent compressions of these. The first time that the model is run this cells should be uncommented in order to save the pickle variables. Additional plots are stored in the correspondant folders.

The .zip file contains all the relevant codes to reproduce the result presented in the master thesis. Additional empty folders are included to create the destination folders where the store variables and plots must be stored. Extract the files from this zip on an empty folder is recommended.

Outside this .zip file the main notebook used to model the GPR is also shown for facilitating the accessibility of code review or in case that only a quick look to the jupyter notebook is required (instead of running all the code).
