# Master-Thesis-2023-ivan-samuel

This repository is created with the objective of providing reproducibility of the results in my Master Thesis to my correctors.

The notebook called modelos_gp_vbl_meteoro.ipynb has commented cells in order to avoid training all the models each time that the results want to be accessed. This is useful to make comprobations and experiment with different visualizations of the results in order to provide more intuitive and transparent compressions of these. The first time that the model is run this cells should be uncommented in order to save the pickle variables. Additional plots are stored in the correspondant folders.
